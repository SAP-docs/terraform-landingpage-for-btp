# The Terraform Providers

In this section we present all available Terraform providers.
We distinguish three stages:
-	*Released*: these providers are generally available and can be used in productive scenarios.
-	*Beta*: these providers are in beta stage and are not intended for productive usage. Nevertheless, we rely on your feedback to promote them to the released stage. Try them out and provide us feedback so that we can make them most valuable for you
-	*On the horizon*: these providers are currently under development and not yet available, but maybe something you are looking forward to.
All providers are open source (Apache 2.0 license) and support Terraform and OpenTofu.
